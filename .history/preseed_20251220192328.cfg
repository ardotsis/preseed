## Boot loader

# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the UEFI partition/boot record if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

# This is how to make the installer shutdown when finished, but not reboot into the installed system.

## Advanced options

# d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks for attempts at buffer overflows or other exploits of the values of a preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful, here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer, automatically.
